# Project: Landing Page

This is the second project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.  
The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The webpages created are [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

In this project, only HTML and CSS files were created, so the pages created are very rudimentary at this stage.  
At the same time, however, I have endeavored to fulfill the specifications described in assets/img.  
I have also tried to implement the best practice for using flexbox and writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).  
I would also like to mention that the image I have used on the webpage is [free-to-use](https://unsplash.com/ko/%EC%82%AC%EC%A7%84/%ED%91%B8%EB%A5%B8-%ED%95%98%EB%8A%98-%EC%95%84%EB%9E%98-%EA%B0%88%EC%83%89-%EC%82%AC%EC%9B%90-V_2UbSfVigw) from Unsplash.

In the near future, I will add more features to the page, including responsive design.

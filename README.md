# Project: Landing Page

This is the second project of the Fundamentals course of The Odin Project.  
The description of the project is [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The webpages created are [here](https://ebaek88.github.io/odin-landing-page/).

In this project, only HTML and CSS files were created, so the pages created are very rudimentary at this stage.  
At the same time, however, I have endeavored to fulfill the specifications described in assets/img.  
I have also tried to implement the best practice for using flexbox and writing git commits, namely the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

In the near future, I will add more features to the page, including responsive design.
